//! Parameter sets for the Regev (Ring-LWE) scheme.
//!
//! The ciphertext modulus `q` is **fixed to the proof-system field prime**
//! (BabyBear: `q = 2^31 - 2^27 + 1 = 2013265921`). This is the key design
//! decision that makes the encryption proof cheap: every `mod q` operation in
//! the scheme is a native field operation in the STARK.
//!
//! # Plaintext modulus and additive homomorphism
//!
//! Messages are scaled by `Δ = floor(q / t)` where `t = 2^plain_bits` is the
//! plaintext modulus. Fresh encryptions carry *binary* coefficients, but
//! decryption decodes each coefficient to a **digit** in `[0, t)`, so
//! ciphertext addition is value-level additive:
//!
//! ```text
//! decrypt_value(Enc(A) + Enc(B)) = A + B
//! ```
//!
//! as long as (a) no coefficient digit reaches `t` (at most `t − 1` stacked
//! additions of binary messages) and (b) the accumulated noise stays below
//! `Δ/2 ≈ q / 2^(plain_bits+1)`. With the default `plain_bits = 8`, that is
//! up to 255 additions digit-wise and a noise budget of ~`2^22`, several
//! thousand additions noise-wise — digits are the binding constraint.
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! Ring-LWE hardness is governed by the ring dimension `n`, the modulus `q`,
//! and the noise width (`Δ`/`plain_bits` only affect correctness, not
//! security). With `q ≈ 2^31` and centered-binomial noise `CBD(η=2)`
//! (σ = 1), `n = 1024` lands at roughly 2^100 classical core-SVP security —
//! usable, but below the 128-bit target. `n = 2048` gives a comfortable
//! margin. **Run the lattice-estimator on your final parameter choice** (see
//! README) before deploying.
